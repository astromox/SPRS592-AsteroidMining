# Any row in this sheet will be disregaurded as long as the Name variable begins with a "#"
"# The types of variables are: numerical, categorical, boolean" 
# Right now there is no differentiation cause by the type variable
#
# The use column is used to vary what value will be used in the simulation. The program will force the variable value to be the use column value.
# For example, specifying 'min' as the use variable will cause the program to only use the min value even if the variable type is randomize
# This is meant to be an easy way to force specific conditions for testing and it is used for discrete variables

# Excavation mass and sizing calculations
# Our assumption is that the main mass component of the excavation equipment is a metal or composite box used to contain asteroid Material
# The mass of this box depends on the asteroid properties and the required amount of water
# An additional mass factor is applied to the box calculated mass to determine the total mass of the excavation system
